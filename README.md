# Madison Milander

I am a senior within the CELS college, majoring in Marine Biology and minoring in GIS and Remote Sensing. I am taking this course 
as a requirement for the minor, but to also challenge me. Coding is something new to me, and I have rarely encountered it within my academic career so far.
