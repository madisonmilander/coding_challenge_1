# Madison Milander

I am a senior within the CELS college, majoring in Marine Biology and minoring in GIS and Remote Sensing. I am taking this course 
as a requirement for the minor, but to also challenge me. Coding is something new to me, and I have rarely encountered it within my academic career so far. 

With my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors. A large part of my childhood was spent outside and around the farm, so being outside isn't second nature to me. 
My process for majoring in Marine Biology was that it combined my love for the outdoors, water, and science aspects all in one area.
